# Roadmap

Planned work. See [DEV.md](DEV.md) for current architecture.

## Data safety

Local-only app, no cloud, no backup — losing the SQLite DB means losing every character. These items harden that.

- [x] **Back up before migrating.** Snapshots `prophecy.db` → `prophecy.db.bak` (via `VACUUM INTO`) before `useMigrations` runs; prod restores it on failure instead of wiping, and drops it on success. See [src/db/backup.ts](src/db/backup.ts).
- [x] **Export / import characters.** Versioned JSON export (share sheet) + import (document picker); adds imported characters as new entries. Pure serialize/validate core is unit-tested. _Media (avatar/portrait) not embedded yet — a future version can base64-embed them._
- [ ] **Production migration-failure UX.** Replace the bare error screen with actionable options: retry, restore backup, export-then-reset. Avoid leaving the user stuck.

## Migration process

- [x] **Forward-migration tests.** Seeds a DB at each prior schema version and replays the remaining `drizzle/*.sql` against better-sqlite3, asserting success. Catches NOT-NULL-without-default, CHECK violations against existing rows, and journal/`.sql` drift. See [src/db/migrations.test.ts](src/db/migrations.test.ts).
- [ ] **Migration authoring guidelines.** Document the safe-change rules in DEV.md: additive columns with defaults, avoid tightening constraints on existing columns, never hand-edit `drizzle/` artifacts.
- [ ] **Add a `db:generate` script** to `package.json` wrapping `drizzle-kit generate` (currently a bare `bunx` command).

## Game content

- [x] **Manage spells** — spellbook with catalogue + editor, disciplines, reserve & spheres.
- [x] **Money** — the four Drac coins tracked on the sheet.
